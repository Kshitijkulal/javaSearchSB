# Supplier Management System

## Overview

The Supplier Management System is designed to manage supplier data and their associated manufacturing processes. It includes features to query suppliers based on location, nature of business, and manufacturing processes.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or later
- Spring Boot 2.6.0 or later
- PostgreSQL (or another compatible SQL database)
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supplier-management-system.git
cd supplier-management-system
2. Configure Database
Update the application.properties file to configure your database connection. Hereâ€™s an example for PostgreSQL:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
3. Initialize Database
Make sure your database schema is set up. Place your data.sql file in the src/main/resources directory to seed initial data.

Example data.sql:

sql
Copy code
-- Sample data for SUPPLIER table
INSERT INTO SUPPLIER (SUPPLIER_ID, COMPANY_NAME, WEBSITE, LOCATION, NATURE_OF_BUSINESS) VALUES
(1, 'ABC Manufacturing', 'http://abc.com', 'India', 'SMALL_SCALE'),
(2, 'XYZ Industries', 'http://xyz.com', 'USA', 'LARGE_SCALE'),
-- Add more suppliers as needed...

-- Sample data for SUPPLIER_PROCESSES table
INSERT INTO SUPPLIER_PROCESSES (SUPPLIER_ID, PROCESS) VALUES
(1, '3D_PRINTING'),
(2, 'MOULDING'),
-- Add more processes as needed...
4. Build and Run
Build the project using Maven or Gradle.

Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Gradle:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
Usage
API Endpoints
Find Suppliers
GET /suppliers

Query suppliers based on location, nature of business, and manufacturing processes.

Request Parameters:

location (String) - e.g., "India"
natureOfBusiness (String) - e.g., "SMALL_SCALE"
processes (Array of Strings) - e.g., ["3D_PRINTING", "COATING"]
page (int) - Page number for pagination (default: 0)
size (int) - Number of records per page (default: 10)
Example Request:

http
Copy code
GET /suppliers?location=India&natureOfBusiness=SMALL_SCALE&processes=3D_PRINTING,COATING&page=0&size=10
Example Response:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "supplierId": 1,
    "companyName": "ABC Manufacturing",
    "website": "http://abc.com",
    "location": "India",
    "natureOfBusiness": "SMALL_SCALE",
    "manufacturingProcesses": ["3D_PRINTING"]
  },
  {
    "supplierId": 4,
    "companyName": "Eco Solutions",
    "website": "http://ecosolutions.com",
    "location": "India",
    "natureOfBusiness": "SMALL_SCALE",
    "manufacturingProcesses": ["COATING"]
  }
  // More suppliers...
]
How It Works
Data Model: The system uses two primary tables:

SUPPLIER for storing supplier details.
SUPPLIER_PROCESSES for storing the manufacturing processes associated with each supplier.
Repository Layer: Custom queries are defined to fetch suppliers based on filtering criteria. For example, findSuppliers method in SupplierRepository fetches suppliers that match the location, nature of business, and manufacturing processes.

Service Layer: Handles business logic and interacts with the repository layer. The SupplierService class provides methods to query and manipulate supplier data.

Controller Layer: Exposes REST endpoints for querying suppliers. The SupplierController class handles incoming requests, invokes service methods, and returns the results.

Troubleshooting
Ensure that your database is up and running.
Verify that the database configuration in application.properties is correct.
Check logs for any errors or warnings related to database connections or queries.
